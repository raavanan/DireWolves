      Direwolves roamed from Canada to Bolivia. (125,000–10,000 years ago)

      Were found in the Western hemisphere.

      They originally evolved in South America.

      Fossils are located east of the Rocky Mountains and include Friesenhahn Cave, Texas, Carroll Cave, Missouri, and Reddick, Florida.

      Ten localities in the central and southeast-central areas of Mexico are known to contain Canis dirus: Cedazo, Aguascalientes; Comondu, Baja California; El Cedral, San Luis Potosí; El Tajo Quarry, Tequixquiac, and Valsequillo, all in Distrito Federal, Mexico; Lago de Chapala, Jalisco; Loltun Cave, Yucatán; Potrecito, Sinaloa; and San Josecito Cave, Nuevo León. Of the central localities, San Josecito Cave and Cedazo have the greatest number of individuals of Canis dirus collected from a single locality. Other localities in Mexico have only a few specimens. A study of specimens from Sonora were confirmed as belonging to Canis dirus guildayi.

      What natural surroundings does the animal need to thrive?
      Habitats include the plains, grasslands and some forested mountain areas of North America. Basically high elevated areas.

      Where does the animal make its home?
      Direwolves mostly slept in caves.</br>

        <label>Diet: What your Friend Fluffy the wolf eats?</label>
        <ol>
          <li>Meat: 70% meat, an adult grey wolf eats an average of 5 to 14 pounds of meat each day. They have large, slicing canine teeth, which evolved to cut through the flesh of prey like a knife through butter.</li>
          <li>Prey primarily on ungulates – large, hoofed mammals such as white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, elk, caribou, bison, Dall sheep, musk oxen, and mountain goats.</li>
          <li>Medium-sized mammals, such as beaver and snowshoe hares, can be an important secondary food source.</li>
