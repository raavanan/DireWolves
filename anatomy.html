      <h1>Anatomy And Biology:</h1>
      <ol>

      <li>The gray wolf is the largest extant member of the Canidae, excepting certain large breeds of domestic dog.Gray wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide i.e
      with the large wolves of Alaska and Canada sometimes weighing 3–6 times more than their Middle Eastern and South Asian cousins
      </li>

      <li>On average, adult wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (32–34 in) in shoulder height. The tail measures 29–50 cm (11–20 in) in length. The ears are 90–110 millimetres (3.5–4.3 in) in height, and the hind feet are 220–250 millimetres (8.7–9.8 in). The mean body mass of the extant gray wolf is 40 kg (88 lb), with the smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg (26 lb) and the largest at 80 kg (176 lb)</li>

      <li>The gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply descending ribcage, a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.</li>
      <li>European wolves may weigh 38.5 kilograms (85 lb), North American wolves 36 kilograms (79 lb) and Indian and Arabian wolves 25 kilograms (55 lb).</li>
      <li>Wolves have big noses to breathe.</li>
      <li>Average life Span is 6-8 years</li>
      </ol>

      <label>Behaviour</label>
      <ol>
      <li>Wolves hunt in pair to get food. They eat meat.</li>
      <li>Wolves use their sharp teeth, great strength, sharp senses and social structure to protect themselvesfrom threats. Wolves are among the most social animals in the world, and through virtue of sheer numbers, they dissuade many would-be predators.</li>
      <li>Wolves normally sleep in short cycles, waking up every two hours or so before going back to sleep.</li>
      </ol>


      The gray wolf usually carries its head at the same level as the back, raising it only when alert. It usually travels at a loping pace, placing its paws one directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8–9 km/h, and allows the wolf to cover great distances. On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds</p>
